These problems relate to the Python package [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), use the famous [iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). Let Machine learning predicting the species of Iris from a flower's sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length.

## How this repository organized
* file [Iris_data_set_TensorFlow.ipynb](https://github.com/TangqiFeng/TensorFlow-Iris/blob/master/Iris_data_set_TensorFlow.ipynb) is generated by basic TensorFlow.
* file [iris_nn.py](https://github.com/TangqiFeng/TensorFlow-Iris/blob/master/iris_nn.py) is using Keras, and this solution is from the class which is programmed by [Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io/).
* file 'iris.csv' is the Iris data set, which can be download from [Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/gh-pages/data/iris.csv)

## Components
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) (a programming language that lets you work quickly
and integrate systems more effectively)
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) (an interactive computing environment that enables users to author notebook documents)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) (the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (An open-source software library for Machine Intelligence)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) (a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.)

## How to run?
After you download the repository

Go to the repository folder, open the command-line interpreter or terminal(mac)
* type:
  ``` $ jupyter notebook ```
  then, click *Iris_data_set_TensorFlow.ipynb* on browser which opened automatically
* type: 
  ``` $ python3 iris_nn.py ```
  then, you can get the results
 
**Before you run the project, mack sure all needed components are installed:**
* [Python3](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python)
* Jupyter, Numpy, Tensorflow and Keras use pip install:

```bash
$ pip install Jupyter / Tensorflow / numpy / Keras 
```
