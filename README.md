These problems relate to the Python package [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), use the famous [iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). Let Machine learning predicting the species of Iris from a flower's sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length.

## Components
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) (a programming language that lets you work quickly
and integrate systems more effectively)
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) (an interactive computing environment that enables users to author notebook documents)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (An open-source software library for Machine Intelligence)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) (a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.)
